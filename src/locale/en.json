    "project4Title": "Secret Friend Raffle",

RecoilJS was used to create information atoms and custom hooks, providing a clear and understandable context for the entire application. React, TypeScript, SASS for page creation and styling. The application's main tests include: Form Test: checks if the input is empty, prevents the addition of new participants, identifies duplicate names and shows error messages when adding a new participant. Participant List Test: covers two scenarios - when the list is empty, it should be displayed without elements, and when it is filled correctly, it shows all participants. The other tests are described in the repository.",
