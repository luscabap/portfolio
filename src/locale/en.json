When clicking on 'View Details', the user is directed to a specific page for each post.",

    "project5Title": "E-commerce Hamburgueria",
    "project5Desc": "The project was developed as a challenge for a job interview.

I am responsible for all stages of website development, including layout, design, documentation and API. The website will have responsiveness, component unit tests, stories in the Storybook and user validation to perform CRUD operations on the sweets. It is worth noting that the website is still under development and is currently my main project.",
